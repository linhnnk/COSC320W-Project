# tryItABunch: runs a function a bunch, and times how long it takes.
#
# Input: myFn: a function which takes as input a list of integers
# Output: lists nValues and tValues so that running myFn on a list of length nValues[i] took (on average over numTrials tests) time tValues[i] milliseconds.
#
# Other optional args:
#    - startN: smallest n to test
#    - endN: largest n to test
#    - stepSize: test n's in increments of stepSize between startN and endN
#    - numTrials: for each n tests, do numTrials tests and average them
#    - listMax: the input lists of length n will have values drawn uniformly at random from range(listMax)
